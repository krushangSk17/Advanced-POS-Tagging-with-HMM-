Part-of-Speech Tagging with HMM
This Python script performs part-of-speech tagging using Hidden Markov Models (HMM). It generates prediction files for test data using both greedy and Viterbi decoding.

Usage
Download the Code: Download hw2_csci544.py to your directory.

Prepare Data: Ensure you have train.json, dev.json, and test.json in the data directory in the same directory.

Run the Script: Execute python hw2_csci544.py in your terminal.

Prediction Files: Vocab file (Vocab.txt) and Prediction files (greedy.json and viterbi.json) will be generated.

Review Predictions: Examine the predicted part-of-speech tags in the generated files.

That's it! You've run the code for part-of-speech tagging with HMM.
