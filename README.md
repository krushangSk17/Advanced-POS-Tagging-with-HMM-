# Readme for Advanced POS Tagging Project

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for an advanced Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging project using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The project employs the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank dataset for tagging.

## Features
- **HMM Implementation**: For POS tagging, utilizing dynamic programming (Viterbi algorithm).
- **Preprocessing**: Robust data preprocessing for optimal model performance.
- **Unknown Word Handling**: Specialized techniques to deal with unknown words in the dataset.

## Results
- Achieved 91.53% accuracy with Greedy decoding and 93.21% with Viterbi decoding on development data.

## Technologies
- Hidden Markov Models, Python, JSON, Natural Language Processing, Greedy and Viterbi Decoding Algorithms, Dynamic Programming.

## Installation & Usage
Instructions on how to set up, train, and evaluate the models are provided in the Jupyter Notebook included in the repository.
